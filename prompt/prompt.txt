Text:
The platypus is a mammal native to Australia.
Unlike most mammals, it lays eggs and has a cloaca.
It has a duck-like bill, webbed feet, and males possess venomous spurs.
The platypus hunts underwater using electroreception to detect prey.
These traits evolved due to long geographic isolation and adaptation to aquatic environments.
